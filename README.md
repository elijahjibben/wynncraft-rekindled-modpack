## Features

More advanced users who use warring features will want to change settings as they have been disabled for simplicity.

### Dynamic Weather

Features a dynamic weather engine created specifically for this modpack! Rain or thunder can randomly occur throughout the map, and areas such as Nemract, Pirate Cove, the Dernal Jungle, and others experience more frequent weather conditions. Areas such as the Silent Expanse and others are free of weather conditions. Traverse through snowstorms in Nesaak, sandstorms in Almuj and other weather hazards! Coupled perfectly with the [Particle Rain](https://modrinth.com/mod/particle-rain) mod with custom settings.
